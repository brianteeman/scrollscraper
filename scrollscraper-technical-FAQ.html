In the original version of Scrollscraper, the software traversed the bible.ort.org website and figured out which verses it needed to include on-the-fly.    It wasn't too important to precisely understand the ORT convention for naming the underlying GIF images which contain the Torah readings.     Each of these GIF files contains three lines of Hebrew text.
<br><br>
In light of the demise of bible.ort.org in late 2022, it became much more important to understand the ORT convention.    What follows is a reverse-engineered interpretation of the filenames, which I believe to be correct:

<b><tt>ccvvqxyz.gif</tt></b> where:
<ul>
	<li><b><tt>cc</tt></b> = the chapter</li>
	<li><b><tt>vv</tt></b> = the verse.   But specifically, it's the LAST verse for which some content is included within this GIF file</li>
	<li><b><tt>q</tt></b> = one of 'C', 'F', or 'D'.    A 'C' file continues the text of the 'ccvv' verse mentioned above, in the following file.   An 'F' file ends cleanly and does not continue.   The rare 'D' files are in the middle of a long verse which began in a previous image and ends in a later image.</li>
	<li><b><tt>x</tt></b> = how many verses start on the first of the three lines in this GIF?</li>
	<li><b><tt>y</tt></b> = how many verses start on the second of the three lines in this GIF?</li>
	<li><b><tt>z</tt></b> = how many verses start on the third of the three lines in this GIF?</li>
</ul>
Examples:
<ul>
	<li> <a href=webmedia/t1/1721F010.gif>t1/1721F010.gif</a> - Genesis 17.    Verse 21 is entirely contained within this file, but it begins with a section of verse 20.    Verse 21 begins somewhere on this second line (of the three lines) of this image.</li>
	<li><a href=webmedia/t2/0203C201.gif>t2/0203C201.gif</a> - Exodus 2.     Verse 3 is the last verse which starts in this file.    Verse 1&2 begin in this file, both on the first of the three lines.    Verse 3 begins on the final of the three lines.</li>
</ul>

	      Through 2022, ScrollScraper worked by retrieving successful screenfuls from the bible.ort.org
	      website, and then assembling a Torah reading from the associated GIFs.   It also optionally examined
	      those GIF images to figure out which sections were dark-blue and which were light-blue, and thereby
	      estimate which sections to hide by shading at the beginning and end of a reading.<p>

	      Following the demise of bible.ort.org in 2022, in order to bring it back online, ScrollScraper had to
	      be modified to operate very differently.   All of the ORT GIF images are now on the ScrollScraper website,
	      and it makes sense to treat this set of Torah images as a unified whole rather than just examining
	      a small set of images for each ScrollScraper user.   Given the amount of effort to effectively address
	      the above-mentioned <b>shading</b> problem in this new environment, it made sense to create a dataset and
	      data structures which could address not only the Shading problem, but also to take advantage of this
	      global knowledge to create the most-requested ScrollScraper feature: TrueType fonts on the right side
	      of the page.<p>

	      The <code>bible.ort.org</code> images are great and must have taken a tremendous amount of work to
	      create, but unfortunately each vertical line is only 30 pixels high and each line is 445 pixels wide.
	      So they're quite granular when you zoom-in or print at high resolution.

	      So now there's a global map for the entire Torah, which knows the start-and-stop coordinates of each
	      Torah verse, and also knows about white space between verses, and even within a verse.   Given that information and the
	      lengths of those segments, and which segments belong to which verse, it's not difficult to interpolate
	      how to partition the (TrueType) Hebrew text of each verse among those segments.  Then if you place
	      those Hebrew fragments in the same position as their corresponding GIF fragment, you've solved
	      the TrueType problem.<p>

	      For example, consider one image's worth of data (there are 6938 such images), from Exodus:<p>
	      <code>
		      % grep t2/1601C101 final_outputs/map.csv<br>
		      t2/1601C101.gif,0,0,137,light,15,26,138,291,NONE,15,26,292,444,dark,15,27<br>
		      t2/1601C101.gif,1,0,444,dark,15,27<br>
		      t2/1601C101.gif,2,0,80,dark,15,27,81,105,NONE,0,0,106,444,light,16,1<br>
	      </code>
	      That's not very human-readable, but let's examine the last line of that output in another format:<p>
	      <table border="3">
		      <th><td>Start-x</td><td>End-x</td><td>Color</td><td>Chapter</td><td>Verse</td></th>
		      <tr><td>0</td><td>80</td><td>dark</td><td>15</td><td>27</td></tr>
		      <tr><td>81</td><td>015</td><td>NONE</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
		      <tr><td>106</td><td>444</td><td>light</td><td>16</td><td>1</td></tr>

    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q:
	      </span>What's the most amazing technical factoid about ScrollScraper?</span>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A:</span>
	      IMHO the most amazing thing is that all of the "Torah image map" and other resources which are pre-computed prior to running ScrollScraper are derived from only the ORT GIF images, their filenames, and the reverse-engineered file naming convention described above.<p>
	      There's a special-case in the code for the smaller TrueType fonts required for the Shirat Hayam (Song of the Sea) and Deuteronomy 32.   There are a handful of <a target=_blank href="https://github.com/jae-63/scrollscraper/blob/master/utilities/handCuration.sed">hand-curated tweaks</a> for a few verses in Shirat Hayam, which provide adjustments to the aforementioned Torah image map.   But that's it.

	      ScrollScraper is now a Dockerized application, so all you need is a Docker environment installed on your computer such as
	      <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/">Docker for Desktop</a>.    Once you've installed Docker and downloaded or git-pulled the <a href="https://github.com/jae-63/scrollscraper/">ScrollScraper source code repo</a> you can run "make docker-buildstamp" to build the ScrollScraper Docker image.   Then you can "docker run" that image and "docker exec" inside of the resulting Docker container, to start experimenting.
	      <p>
	      Once you've exec'd into the container, you can run:
	      <code>cd /var/opt/scrollscraper; make test-scrollscraper.html</code>
