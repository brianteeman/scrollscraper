In the original version of Scrollscraper, the software traversed the bible.ort.org website and figured out which verses it needed to include on-the-fly.    It wasn't too important to precisely understand the ORT convention for naming the underlying GIF images which contain the Torah readings.     Each of these GIF files contains three lines of Hebrew text.
<br><br>
In light of the demise of bible.ort.org in late 2022, it became much more important to understand the ORT convention.    What follows is a reverse-engineered interpretation of the filenames, which I believe to be correct:

<b><tt>ccvvqxyz.gif</tt></b> where:
<ul>
	<li><b><tt>cc</tt></b> = the chapter</li>
	<li><b><tt>vv</tt></b> = the verse.   But specifically, it's the LAST verse for which some content is included within this GIF file</li>
	<li><b><tt>q</tt></b> = one of 'C', 'F', or 'D'.    A 'C' file continues the text of the 'ccvv' verse mentioned above, in the following file.   An 'F' file ends cleanly and does not continue.   The rare 'D' files are in the middle of a long verse which began in a previous image and ends in a later image.</li>
	<li><b><tt>x</tt></b> = how many verses start on the first of the three lines in this GIF?</li>
	<li><b><tt>y</tt></b> = how many verses start on the second of the three lines in this GIF?</li>
	<li><b><tt>z</tt></b> = how many verses start on the third of the three lines in this GIF?</li>
</ul>
Examples:
<ul>
	<li> <a href=webmedia/t1/1721F010.gif>t1/1721F010.gif</a> - Genesis 17.    Verse 21 is entirely contained within this file, but it begins with a section of verse 20.    Verse 21 begins somewhere on this second line (of the three lines) of this image.</li>
	<li><a href=webmedia/t2/0203C201.gif>t2/0203C201.gif</a> - Exodus 2.     Verse 3 is the last verse which starts in this file.    Verse 1&2 begin in this file, both on the first of the three lines.    Verse 3 begins on the final of the three lines.</li>
</ul>

	      IMHO the most amazing thing is that all of the "Torah image map" and other resources which are pre-computed prior to running ScrollScraper are derived from only the ORT GIF images, their filenames, and the reverse-engineered file naming convention described above.<p>
	      There's a special-case in the code for the smaller TrueType fonts required for the Shirat Hayam (Song of the Sea) and Deuteronomy 32.   There are a handful of <a target=_blank href="https://github.com/jae-63/scrollscraper/blob/master/utilities/handCuration.sed">hand-curated tweaks</a> for a few verses in Shirat Hayam, which provide adjustments to the aforementioned Torah image map.   But that's it.

	      ScrollScraper is now a Dockerized application, so all you need is a Docker environment installed on your computer such as
	      <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/">Docker for Desktop</a>.    Once you've installed Docker and downloaded or git-pulled the <a href="https://github.com/jae-63/scrollscraper/">ScrollScraper source code repo</a> you can run "make docker-buildstamp" to build the ScrollScraper Docker image.   Then you can "docker run" that image and "docker exec" inside of the resulting Docker container, to start experimenting.
	      <p>
	      Once you've exec'd into the container, you can run:
	      <code>cd /var/opt/scrollscraper; make test-scrollscraper.html</code>.
